# SparkletX
"Educational Applets"

## Welcome
This repo is a newer version of Sparklet, my failed attempt at putting together a decent-looking website :P

I'm making this to eventually be able to host helpful learning material on here and help other students
learn more easily in school. Best of all, the site is 100% freeware (no greedy subscription plans), and the
backend is also completely open-source.

## Contributions
Feel free to make pull requests, but your code has to be readable and not
have any major security vulnerabilities/performance issues.

Also, please split up your contributions into separate pull requests, since
I might want to accept one, but I can't because it includes something else
that got rejected.

## FOR DEVS
If you find a security vulnerability, you can DM me on
Twitter @Carbonado870 or on Discord (Dexie With Drip#8426)
